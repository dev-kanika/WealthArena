# WealthArena Runtime Dependencies
# Canonical runtime requirements used by scripts and Docker
# This file contains all dependencies needed to run the API and ingestion scripts

# Azure Deployment Notes
# - chromadb (line 19) has heavy dependencies with native extensions
# - First Azure deployment may take 15-20 minutes due to compilation
# - The .deployment file and SCM_BUILD_TIMEOUT app setting accommodate this
# - Subsequent deployments are faster due to Azure's build caching
