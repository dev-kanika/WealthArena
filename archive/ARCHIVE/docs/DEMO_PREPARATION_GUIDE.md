## Q&A Preparation

**Expected Questions:**

**Q1: How accurate are the RL model predictions?**

**A:** "Our models are trained with a target win rate of 70%+. In backtesting, we achieved [X]% win rate across [Y] trades. The models use trend reversal rewards and risk management constraints to optimize for consistent profitability rather than maximum returns."

**Q2: How does the chatbot knowledge base work?**

**A:** "We use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with a curated knowledge base of 80+ financial terms scraped from Investopedia. The chatbot uses Chroma vector database for semantic search and GROQ's llama3-8b-8192 model for generating educational responses. If a user asks about RSI, the system retrieves relevant context and generates a tailored explanation."

**Q3: What data sources do you use?**

**A:** "We ingest data from Yahoo Finance (free tier) for 443 symbols across 5 asset classes: ASX stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex pairs, commodities, and ETFs. We download 3 years of historical OHLCV data and compute 20+ technical indicators using Polars for performance. All data is stored in Azure SQL Database for fast querying."

**Q4: How do you ensure the game is educational?**

**A:** "The game uses real historical market data, so users experience actual market conditions from the past 3 years. We provide AI-powered hints, explain trade outcomes, and award XP for learning. The progressive XP system ensures users complete educational content before accessing advanced features like portfolio analytics."

**Q5: What's your deployment strategy?**

**A:** "We use a multi-cloud approach with both Azure and GCP for redundancy. Services are deployed as managed Web Apps (Azure) or App Engine (GCP) using native runtimes (Node.js 20, Python 3.11) without Docker. This simplifies deployment and reduces costs. We use Azure SQL Database and Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for data storage."

**Q6: How do you handle real-time updates?**

**A:** "We use polling for leaderboard (30-second intervals) and notifications (30-second intervals). For production, we'd implement WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for true real-time updates. The current approach balances simplicity with functionality for the demo."

**Q7: What's next for the platform?**

**A:** "Post-demo improvements include: live trading integration (paper trading first), social features (follow traders, copy portfolios), advanced analytics (factor attribution, regime detection), mobile app optimization (reduce bundle size, improve performance), and production deployment with custom domain and SSL."
