Extracted Segments (Verbatim)
Section C. Agentic Multi-Agent Trading & Strategy Library
•	Library of base strategies: momentum, mean-reversion, statistical arbitrage, pairs trading, sector rotation, carry strategies.
•	Multi-instrument agents: stocks, ETFs, futures, options (vanilla & basic Greeks), crypto, FX.
•	Strategy composition: meta-controller that composes agents by regime detection.
•	Reinforcement learning agents: PPO, SAC, A2C, or off-policy (DQN variants for discrete actions).
•	Hierarchical RL: high-level allocator + low-level execution policies.
•	Offline RL pretraining on historical buffers; online fine-tuning in paper-trading.
•	Strategy ensembling & model distillation for lightweight live execution.

Section L. Experimentation & Training Infrastructure (Agent-Focused Items Only)
•	Offline Pretraining of Agents
o Pre-train RL trading policies on historical datasets (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Quandl, WRDS) before live deployment.
o Use offline RL techniques (conservative Q-learning, CQL; batch-constrained deep Q-learning, BCQ) to reduce the risk of catastrophic exploration in live markets.
o Allow simulation of different market regimes (e.g., 2008 crash, COVID shock) to stress-test agent robustness.
•	Reward Shaping & Multi-Objective Optimization
o Extend reward functions beyond raw returns: penalize drawdowns, volatility, overexposure to one asset class, or slippage.
o Multi-objective reward: balance return vs. risk, liquidity, ESG goals, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, etc.
o Enable customizable user-driven reward shaping: e.g., “maximize returns but cap daily loss at 1%.”
•	Covariance-Aware Portfolio Risk Management
o Compute covariance and correlation matrices across assets dynamically.
o Use these to construct hedges (long/short pairs, factor hedging, index vs. stock hedges).
o Implement risk-parity portfolio balancing and minimum variance optimization (Markowitz, Black-Litterman extensions).
o Allow agents to automatically adjust exposure in correlated instruments (e.g., hedging oil ETFs with airline shorts).

Section 7. Technical Architecture Recommendations & Tooling (Agentic-Oriented Parts)
•	Orchestration & Agent Coordination
• LangGraph or LangChain Core — multi-agent orchestration and workflow composition (discovery → signal fusion → planner → execution).

•	Models & ML Infrastructure
• PyTorch (primary) with optional JAX for specialized model speedups.
• RL libraries: Stable Baselines3, Ray-RL or RLlib, CleanRL, or custom PPO/SAC implementations.
• Time-series & forecasting: Temporal Fusion Transformer, N-BEATS, WaveNet/TCN.
• Fine-tuning & adapters: Axolotl or PEFT for adapter-based tuning; use for strategy LLM fine-tuning.
• Model serving: BentoML, TorchServe or Triton for performant endpoints.
• Distributed compute: Ray for parallel backtests and distributed training.
•	Backtesting & Simulation Tools
• Vectorized backtest engines (custom or libraries like Backtrader, zipline-style patterns).
• Monte Carlo & scenario tooling (NumPy, Pandas, custom Cython for speed).
• Orderbook / market impact simulators (custom modules or lightweight open-source libs).

Section F. Backtest, Evaluation & What-If Simulation (Agent Evaluation-Relevant)
•	Vectorized backtester with walk-forward testing.
•	Bootstrapped / Monte Carlo scenario testing.

________________________________________
Section G. News, NLP & Signal Fusion (Agent Observation Inputs)
•	LLM pipeline for event extraction & reasoning (summaries of earnings calls, “tone” analyses).
•	Named entity linking across filings and news.
•	Cross-modal fusion: numeric + text + event embeddings into agent observation vectors.
________________________________________
Section E. Portfolio Construction & Risk Management (Agent Control Context)
•	Hedging module: delta-hedging for options, synthetic hedges using ETFs/futures.
•	Scenario & stress testing: user-defined shocks (rate hikes, regime shift, sudden drawdown).
•	Risk metrics: VaR, CVaR, drawdown, max drawdown, Sharpe, Sortino, turnover, exposures.
•	Rebalancing policies & automated rebalancing engine.

Section D. Execution, Market Microstructure & Simulation (Agent Execution Context)
•	Order models: market, limit, IOC, FOK; basic orderbook simulation.
•	Transaction costs model: spreads, commissions, slippage, market impact (Kyle model).
•	Paper-trading & live-sandbox connectors (Alpaca, Interactive Brokers sandbox, CCXT for crypto).
•	Latency and fill simulation: configurable delay distributions and slippage.
